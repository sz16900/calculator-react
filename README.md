# [React Project: Calculator App]

In this project, I am going to make a React calculator application to demonstrate mastery of building React components by following step-by-step guidelines from a fake company based in "France". Awesomized with pure CSS. This project is completed by Seth Zea, in partial requirements of the Microverse cirriculum.
